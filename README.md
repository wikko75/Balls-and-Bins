# Balls-and-Bins
Presentation of Balls and bins problem <br>
## Overview <br>
**m** balls are thrown independently, one by one, into **n > 0** numbered bins with equal propability P = 1/n <br>

## What for? <br>
We want to obtain certain characteristics: <br>
- **Bn** – the moment of the first collision <br> **Bn = k** if the k-th of the balls thrown is the first to be in a bin where there is already a ball **(birthday paradox)**
- **Un** – the number of empty bins after throwing in **n** balls
- **Ln** – the maximum number of balls in the bins after throwing **n** balls **(maximum load)**
- **Cn** – the minimum number of throws, after which each bin has at least one ball **(coupon collector's problem)**
- **Dn** – the minimum number of throws, after which each bin has at least two balls **(coupon collector's brother)**
- **Dn−Cn** – the number of throws since Cn that are needed so that there are at least two balls in each bin
